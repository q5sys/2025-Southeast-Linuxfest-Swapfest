# 2025-Southeast-Linuxfest-Swapfest

Over the past few years, we've had a Retro Linux Ragchew where we talk about and install old Linux versions on old hardware.
Every year there's always comments from people that fall into three categories.
- They have something they should have brought.
- They have something that they dont need/want anymore and wish they could find someone who would enjoy it.
- They have been looking for something but cant find it anywhere.

So for 2025 were going to do something a little different.
