FAQ:

What can I bring?
Anything that you think would be interesting to other people.

How old does it have to be?
It doesn't have to be 20+ years old.  A good way to look at it would be that it should be old enough that you wouldn't find it being purchased by a business to put into production.  But things 5-10 years old that would be useful for a homelab is fine.

How does the 'Swapping' work?
While you can directly barter item for item, because it's unlikely that you will both agree to the same value for your unique items... We will allow a 'intermediary' thing of value to be used.  
Whether that's Bitcoin, another crypto, gold pressed latinum, or rectangular pieces of cotton with a greenish ink on them is solely up to the individuals to decide.

How can I register?
You can file an issue in this repo and I'll get everything added to the readme table.  Please give as much info as possible.

Do I need to register if I'm only interested in leaving with something?
No, the event is open to anyone who wants to look at what's available to find a new home.

What if I bring something and no one wants it?
Then you take it home.  Anything left on prem will result in you being publicly shamed in our telegram/matrix channels and forever being known as someone who abandons old retro hardware to the dumpster.

If I'm interested in an item can I let the owner know?
There will be a field in the GitHub readme table where I can add the names of the interested party. If you want to be added to that, create an issue with the information of what item you are interested in.

How often will the GitHub repo be updated?
Depending on the number of submissions, probably 24-48 hours.
